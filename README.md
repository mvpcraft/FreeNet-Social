# Social Application

Welcome to the codebase for our decentralized social networking application.

## Overview

This is a cross-platform social application available on:

- Web
- iOS
- Android

## Development Resources

This application is built with React Native and written in TypeScript. It leverages the AT Protocol TypeScript packages for decentralized social networking functionality.

A small Go language component handles the web service that serves the React Native Web application.

### Getting Started

Refer to the Build Instructions documentation to begin working with the application.

### Understanding the Protocol

The Authenticated Transfer Protocol (AT Protocol) is a decentralized social media protocol. While understanding AT Protocol is not required to work with this application, familiarity with its concepts can be beneficial.

Key resources include:

- Protocol Overview and Guides
- Community Discussions
- Protocol Specifications
- Technical documentation on self-authenticating data structures

The application implements a set of schemas and APIs built within the AT Protocol framework.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions while prioritizing high-quality issues and pull requests. Adherence to the following guidelines will ensure a timely review.

### Policies

- Response to issues or pull requests is not guaranteed.
- Issues or pull requests may be closed with limited feedback.
- Discussions or contributions may be locked if volume becomes unmanageable.
- Support for build-related issues is not provided.

### Guidelines

- Search for existing issues before creating a new one.
- Open an issue for discussion before submitting a pull request.
- Avoid pull requests that:
  - Make superficial branding changes
  - Refactor the codebase without prior approval
  - Introduce entirely new features without prior discussion

We serve a broad user community and must carefully prioritize our efforts. Well-written pull requests that solve problems concisely are greatly appreciated. For larger experimental changes, please consider forking the repository.

## Forking Guidelines

You are welcome to fork this application. However, clear differentiation from the original project is essential.

When forking, please ensure you:

- Update all branding throughout the repository and user interface.
- Replace support links (feedback, email, terms of service) with your own resources.
- Substitute any analytics or error-collection systems with your own implementations.

## Security Disclosures

If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them via the designated security contact. Reports are distributed to the entire team for prompt response.

## Building on the Protocol

This project is built on an open protocol designed to prevent developer lock-out from ecosystems they help create. Third-party integration can be as seamless as first-party development through custom feeds, federated services, clients, and additional extensions.
